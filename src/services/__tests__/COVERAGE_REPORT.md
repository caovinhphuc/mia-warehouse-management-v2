## 🎯 Analysis

### ✅ Excellent Coverage

- **googleSheetsApi.js**: 100% statements, 100% functions
  - All methods are tested
  - Good test coverage for all operations

### ⚠️ Needs Improvement

#### googleDriveApi.js (31.74%)

- **Missing coverage**: Lines 61-96, 124-190
- **Needs**: More test cases for edge cases and error handling

#### securityService.js (44.24%)

- **Missing coverage**: Many lines in MFA, SSO, RBAC sections
- **Needs**: Tests for MFA, SSO, RBAC features

#### websocketService.js (8.51%) - **Priority**

- **Missing coverage**: Lines 29-270 (almost entire file)
- **Needs**: Complete test suite for WebSocket operations
- **Priority**: High - This is critical functionality

## 📝 Recommendations

### Priority 1: websocketService.js

**Current**: 8.51% coverage
**Target**: > 80% coverage

**Missing Tests**:

- [ ] Connection management (connect, disconnect, reconnect)
- [ ] Event handling (on, off, emit)
- [ ] Room management (joinRoom, leaveRoom)
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Reconnection logic
- [ ] Health check (ping/pong)

### Priority 2: securityService.js

**Current**: 44.24% coverage
**Target**: > 70% coverage

**Missing Tests**:

- [ ] MFA functions (generateMFASecret, verifyMFAToken)
- [ ] SSO functions
- [ ] RBAC functions
- [ ] Audit logging
- [ ] Token refresh

### Priority 3: googleDriveApi.js

**Current**: 31.74% coverage
**Target**: > 70% coverage

**Missing Tests**:

- [ ] File upload with progress
- [ ] File download
- [ ] Folder operations
- [ ] Permission management
- [ ] Error handling for edge cases

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Add comprehensive tests for websocketService.js
2. **Short-term**: Expand securityService.js tests (MFA, SSO, RBAC)
3. **Medium-term**: Complete googleDriveApi.js test coverage
4. **Long-term**: Maintain 100% coverage for googleSheetsApi.js

## 📈 Progress Tracking

- [x] Phase 1.1: Unit Testing - **COMPLETED**

  - [x] googleSheetsApi.test.js - ✅ 100% coverage
  - [x] googleDriveApi.test.js - ⚠️ 31.74% coverage
  - [x] securityService.test.js - ⚠️ 44.24% coverage
  - [x] websocketService.test.js - ❌ 8.51% coverage (needs work)

- [ ] Phase 1.2: Integration Testing - **NEXT**
- [ ] Phase 1.3: E2E Testing - **PENDING**

## 💡 Tips

1. **Focus on websocketService.js first** - It's critical and has lowest coverage
2. **Test error cases** - Many uncovered lines are error handling
3. **Test edge cases** - Boundary conditions and unusual inputs
4. **Mock external dependencies** - Ensure tests are isolated
